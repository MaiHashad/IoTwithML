## Build a Simple Proximity Detection Device

 The goal of this project is to use the ultrasonic range finder to measure the distance to an object from the Argon.

## Required hardware
(1) Particle Argon â€” this project assumes you've set up your Argon. If you've not done that yet, follow the instructions here before you begin this project. <br />
(2) Grove shield for Particle Mesh <br />
(3) Chainable RGB LED V2 <br />
(4) Ultrasonic range finder <br />
(5) Grove wires

## Connection:
D2 ->	RGB LED <br />
D4 ->	Ultrasonic range finder
